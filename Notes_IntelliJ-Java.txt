IntelliJ for Java:

Use shortcuts to comment and uncomment lines and blocks of code:
Ctrl+/: for single line comments (//... )
Ctrl+Shift+/: for block comments (/*...*/ )

All Java programs contain at least one function (named 'main'); each function consists of:
	-a ReturnType (ex/ void {which does not return anything} );
	-the func Name (should clearly identify the purpose of the func);
	-next, within parenthesis, come the func Parameters;
	-then come the braces {} which contain the Java code.

	so an sample function would look as follows:
	
	****************************
		void sendEmail () {
		   ...
		}
	****************************

In Java, functions exist within CLASSES (with 'Main' class specified for the 'main' function);

	NOTE: In Java, functions within classes are referred to as "methods."
	....so, class Main contains the 'main' method.

	ALSO NOTE: 	classes use Pascal Naming Convention (ex/ MainEventYesterday)
			methods use Camel Naming Convention (ex/ wildCardsToday)

	*** It is prudent to treat Java syntax as case-sensitive. ***

Java requires that Classes and methods include 'AccessModifiers' which are keywords (ex/ 'public', 'private', and others) that determine 
if other Classes & methods can access the target Class & method 

Last, the 'static' keyword is used to describe how objects are managed in memory. It means the 'static' object belongs specifically to a
Class instead of being reused for other instances of that Class.

	*** Always make the 'main' method a 'static' object. ***
	
	so a sample class & method combination would look as follows:

	****************************
		public class Main {
		   public static void main() {
		   // this is how you comment in Java
		   // remember to end Java program statements with a semi-colon (;)
		      ...
		   }
		}
	****************************

To run Java compiler via command terminal:
	-Right-click the .java program tab;
	-select 'Open in Terminal';
	-Run Java compiler (javac.exe) using
		>start c:"\Program Files\Java\jdk-14.0.1\bin\javac.exe" main.java
		>start c:"path\to\javac.exe" thisIsjavaprgm.java
