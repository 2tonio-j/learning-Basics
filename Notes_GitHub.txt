GitHub Notes:

To clone a remote repository (repo) onto a local repository (my computer):
  1. Copy the web URL for the remote repo you want (using 'Clone or Download' button under '<> Code' tab on GitHub account)
  2. On local machine, navigate to desired location for Local Repo; then type:
	>git clone insert_copied/web/URL_here

To determine which repo BRANCH you are currently using:
	>git status	**NOTE: must be in a directory containing a cloned repository (a Local Repo).

To create a new directory within the Local Repo:
	>mkdir new_directory_name	**NOTE: must be in the Local Repo (current wd) -OR- specify path to the Local Repo.

Committing changes to a Remote Repo froma Local Repo is a 3-step process:
  1. MARK FOR COMMITTING (files or directory)
	>git add .	**NOTE: using '.' marks everything in the working directory (wd) that has not been committed.
	or
	>git add \Path\

	ASIDE: using >git status AFTER applying 'git add' will show all files newly marked for committing.

  2. COMMIT CHANGES (commits all files currently makred)
	>git commit -m "insert message here...a msg is always required"		**NOTE: -m stands for message.

	ASIDE: using 'git status' AFTER 'git commit' will show the Local Repo is AHEAD of ORIGIN.
	
	2nd ASIDE:  if "Tell me who you are," then do:
		>git config user.email "insert.email@email.com"
		>git config user.name "any name you want"

  3. PUSH TO REMOTE REPO (publish our changes to GitHub)
	>git push	**NOTE: this command will update the Remote Repo with the new commits that were executed on Local Repo.

To bring changes from Remote Repo to Local Repo:
	>git pull.......

Adding existing project (directory) to GitHub using command line.
  1. Create new Remote Repo on GitHub;
  2. Launch Git Bash (from directory containing git-bash.exe)
	@ c:\Program Files\Git
	>git-bash.exe			** Git Bash is runs in LINUX **
	
  3. (In git bash) navigate to project directory (this will become the Local Repo).
  4.
